Reflection No Reflection is a proof of concept to create an API that is 100% compatible with the Java core reflection API, but without any reflection. 

We hope to create a new technology that can improve all reflection based libraries for Android and Java.

The main idea is to create a reflection compatible API using annotation processing and byte code weaving.

This project has been initiated by the Android Groupon team, 2014.
